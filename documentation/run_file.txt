"context" and "page" fixtures are not supported in "beforeAll" since they are created on a per-test basis.
If you would like to reuse a single page between tests, create context manually with browser.newContext(). See https://aka.ms/playwright/reuse-page for details.
If you would like to configure your page before each test, do that in beforeEach hook instead.


npx playwright test  --- open all browser  
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium ---- open specific browser
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium example.spec.js  ---- open specific browser and specific test file
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium -g "Validation add to product 1"
npx playwright test --workers=4
npx playwright test DataParameter_E2E.spec.js --reporter=allure-playwright
